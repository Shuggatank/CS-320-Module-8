## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure the code is functional and secure we need to create unbias and complete test cases for the program. Creating unbias test ensures that the code gets complete coverage without any manipulation of the data. Unbias test also follow the requirements of the project more closely because you aren't just writing test just to make your code appear to be functional but actually writing test to make sure your code meets requirements. 

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I try to break down the user needs into smaller, more manageable parts. By doing so I can understand the users needs a little bit better and more close implement what they want. With the smaller user needs the program can be built piece by piece.  

## How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by breaking down the requirements and create pseudocode and UML diagrams to visualize what I'm working on. Doing this early in the process lets me work on the overall design and construct of the software. Furthermore, having a breakdown of the requirements lets me quickly reference to what I need to work on and check off what has been completed.
